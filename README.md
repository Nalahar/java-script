# java-script

This is collection of small projects I built for my use.
The usages is to copy paste java script code to fulfill the need, and to practice to expand my knowledge.
Each individual project has its own use cases written in its own readme files.

For now, my projects are oriented to:
1. Provide simple SVG viewing capabilities (pan, zoom, ...)
2. Provide GraphViz viewing ( I love .dot graphs, and I think it is amazing I can use text to visualize graphs fast)

Some general requirements:
1. The code has to be self contained. External links and downloads are not something I want. Copy paste and use.
2. The code must have examples on how to use it.
3. The code must be clean, and human readable. Suitable for education and security.
4. The code must be commented.

Planned: 
1. Automated testing
2. Security
3. Backwards compatibility

Environment:
Visual Studio Code
Chrome
Edge

Extensions are exported from VS Code terminal with command:
code --list-extensions > extensions.list

Extensions can be imported from VS Code terminal with command:
cat extensions.list |% { code --install-extension $_}

All feedback is welcomed :)
