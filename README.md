# java-script

This is collection of small projects I built for my use.
The usages are either to copy paste java script code (no need to install thus easy setup) to fulfill the need, and to practice to expand my knowledge.
Each individual project has its own use cases written in its own readme files.

For now, my projects are oriented to:
1. Provide simple SVG viewing capabilities (pan, zoom, ...)
2. Provide GraphViz viewing or.
